# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, and data prediction on Credit Card dataset

It is really important to detect any Credit Card Fraud taking place. The credit card companies need to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle.com. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. It consists of 31 attributes and 284807 records. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

This data is highly unbalanced and I have tried to perform undersampling.It basically means removing data in order to have a more balanced dataset and thus avoiding our models to overfitting.
